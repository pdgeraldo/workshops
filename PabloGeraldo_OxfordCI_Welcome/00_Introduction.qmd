# Why should we care about causal inference? {background-color="#00a191"}

## 

<br>
The social sciences are experimenting what some authors have called a "credibility revolution" (Angrist and Pischke, 2010), an "identification revolution" (Morgan, 2016), or simply a "causal revolution" (Pearl and MacKenzie, 2018)

. . .

In artificial intelligence/ML, causality have been deemed [**"the next frontier"**](https://phys.org/news/2019-02-causal-disentanglement-frontier-ai.html) and [**"the next most important thing"**](https://www.datasciencecentral.com/profiles/blogs/causality-the-next-most-important-thing-in-ai-ml)

. . .

The enormous progress in the last decades has been facilitated by the development of mathematical frameworks that provide researchers with a precise language to handle causal questions: [Potential Outcomes]{.fragment .highlight-red} and the [Structural Causal Model]{.fragment .highlight-red}


# But, really, why should *I* care? {background-color="#00a191"}

## What is your estimand?

Researchers, at least social scientists, tend to formalize their effect of interest as **regression coefficients** (i.e., their hypothesis are formulated within a statistical model)

[[**This is too restrictive!**]()]{.fragment .fade-in}

. . . 

Potential outcomes offer a way to formalize what we mean by a *causal effect* outside any statistical model. Graphical models provides a way to formalize our *assumptions* without parametric restrictions.

. . .

This allows us to clearly separate *what do we want* (a certain **estimand**), what needs to be true so we get what we want (**identifying assumptions**), the statistical machinery to transform data into an answer for our question (an **estimator**), and the particular answer we get (our empirical **estimate**).

Lundberg, Johnson, and Stewart (2021) discuss this point in great detail. Absolutely worth reading! Ungated version [here](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ba67n/).

## Course content

::: callout-tip

The course introduces students to contemporary frameworks of “counterfactual” causal inference, emphasizing the complementarities between potential outcomes (a.k.a., Neyman-Rubin causal model) and the structural causal model (a.k.a., Wright-Pearl graphical approach). The focus will be on identification and estimation of causal effects using observational data as encountered in social science applications

:::

* Week 1: Introduction to Potential Outcomes and the experimental ideal

* Week 2: Introduction to the Structural Causal Model and Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs)

* Week 3: Selection on observables I (matching, regression, weighting)

* Week 4: Selection on observables II (machine learning approaches)

* Week 5: As-if-random assignment (instrumental variables and regression discontinuity)

* Week 6: Parallel trends and beyond (difference-in-differences and synthetic control)

* Week 7: Partial identification and sensitivity analysis

* Week 8: Credible causal inference beyond research templates

**Teaching**: Weekly two-hour lectures

**Assessment**: Problem sets every other week (theory and applications)

**Pre-requisites**: Basic probability and statistics (up to [generalized] linear models). Practical exercises in R. 

* Don't worry! There are plenty of refreshers and crash courses

* If worried, just send me an email
