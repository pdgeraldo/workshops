## Finding as-if random variation

Instrumental variables are a popular strategy when unconfoundedness does not hold, but we have some source of variation in the treatment status that is as-good-as-random, even if only in a particular subpopulation

We will discuss identification and estimation in the instrumental variable setting under two frameworks:

. . . 

* The canonical setting, where a constant treatment effect is assumed 

. . . 

* The modern approach, where heterogeneous treatment effect are allowed

. . .

Depending on the invoked assumptions, the quantity identified by the IV analysis is different

We will discuss in certain detail the common issues faced by all IV analyses, and also some issues particular to each framework

. . .

:::{.callout-warning}
As described by Felton and Stewart (2024), IV is a powerful strategy, but a very fragile one that should be handled with care!
:::

## Intuition for IV

Originally, the IV analysis was developed to deal with endogenous systems in equilibrium: how to determine the effect of supply on demand (and vice versa!) if they always meet at a single point?

**Solution**: Find "exogeneous shifters" for one of them! 

. . .

In the modern IV setting, the intuition is a little simpler: if we cannot randomise the treatment of interest, can we find an (as-if) random variable that *encourages* treatment taking?

. . .

Imagine if we want to test the hypothesis: [Does attending this workshop improves your productivity in the long-term?]()

* Can we directly compare the ones who attended to the ones who didn't attend?

* Can we randomise who *actually* attended the workshop?

* Can we randomise *invitations* to the workshop, or reminders?

* Can we construct a variable that predicts who attended, independent of potential productivity? (would schedule conflicts work?)

## Intuition for IV

If we could actually randomise the reminders, then we would have an experiment!

But remember, we want the effect of *attending* the workshop, not the effect of *being invited* to it!

$$
ATE_{\text{workshop}} = E[P_a - P_{\bar{a}}]
$$
$$
ATE_{\text{reminder}} = E[P_r - P_{\bar{r}}]
$$
The first one is the effect of interest, the second one is called the *intent to treat* (ITT) effect.

:::{.callout-note}
Under which conditions would they be equivalent?
:::

## From ITT to the treatment effect

If our assumptions are true 

* i.e., that receiving a reminder to attend the workshop only affects people's productivity through the workshop itself

then the ITT estimate comes only from the population that changed their attendance because of the invitation!

* So, the $ATE_{\text{reminder}}$ is an average of (a) the effect of the reminder sent on productivity among the switchers, and (b) the zero effect from non-switchers

In other words, the ITT is a diluted version of the effect of interest. Can we work back to the quantity we want? Kind of

## Complier types

To re-scale the ITT, we need to estimate the probability of switching the attendance to the workshop due to the reminder --> Randomisation!

But in order to use that information, we need some further clarifications. Let's divide the population in four latent subgroups:

. . .

* **Never-takers** : those we don't care about causal inference, or about workshops, so they won't come anyways. What's the effect of the reminder for them?

. . . 

* **Compliers**: the forgetful (like me), so they will attend if reminded but not otherwise. What's the effect of the reminder for them?

. . . 

* **Always-takers**: the highly organized and quantitative geeks, that would attend under any circumstances. What's the effect for this group?

. . .

*  **Defiers**: those who were planned to attend, but when reminded (and after re-reading the workshop description), they would rather not! *We assume that this group does not exist*

## Graphical representation

![](img\IV.pdf){fig-align="center" width=50%}

## Non-parametric asssumptions {background-color="#002F87"}

In graphical terms, the non-parametric IV conditions are:

* The instrument $Z$ and the treatment $D$ are $d-$connected in the observational DAG $G$

* The instrument $Z$ and the outcome $Y$ are $d-$separated in the interventional DAG where we $do(z)$, $G_{\overbar_{X}}$

## IV bounds

Under no additional restrictions, i.e., from the non-parametric assumptions encoded in the DAG alone, the treatment effect **cannot** be identified.

However, we can: 1) test the null hypothesis of no treatment effect, 2) obtain bounds for the treatment effect


# Classical IV {background-color="#17a091"}
## Effect homogeneity

## Identification

Traditionally, the IV assumptions are described in terms of two linear model and their error terms:

[First stage](): $D = \tau + \rho Z + \eta$

[Second stage](): $Y = \gamma + \alpha D + \epsilon$

:::{.callout-tip}
## IV identification assumptions

* **Exogeneity and exclusion**: $C(Z,\eta)=0$, and $C(Z,\epsilon) =0$

* **Relevance of first stage**: $\rho \neq 0$

* **Constant effect**: $\alpha = Y_{1i} - Y_{0i} ~ \forall i$

## Effect heterogeneity

## LATE framework

Assuming effect heterogeneity, the estimand of interest is not the "total effect" anymore, but a new quantity:

. . . 

The Local Average Treatment Effect (LATE). Formally:

$$
E[\underbrace{Y_{d=1,i} - Y_{d=0,i}}_{\text{treatment effect}} \vert \underbrace{D_{z=1,i} \gt D_{z=0,i}}_{\text{among compliers}}]
$$

. . . 

In words, we aim to identify the effect of the treatment $D$ on the outcome $Y$, *only among* those that are induced to receive the treatment $D=1$ by the instrument $Z$

Note that this population of *compliers* can be substantially different than the total population!

. . . 

The IV-LATE assumptions we are going to discuss now are embedded in this quantity formalization

## Assumptions

### Relevance

$$
E[D_{z=1,i} - D_{z=0,i}] \neq 0
$$

. . . 

**Relevance** is the assumption that the instruments does indeed makes a difference!

It is an assumption about the $Z \rightarrow D$

. . .

Is this a testable assumption?

Is it necessary for the association between $Z$ and $D$ to be causal?

## Assumptions

### Unconfoundedness of the instrument

$$
Y_{(d,z),i} \indep Z_i \forall d,z
$$

. . . 

It reads: The joint potential outcomes (depending on the treatment $D$ and the instrument $Z$) are independent of the instrument $Z$

Can you think of a graphical criteria for this?

. . .

$$
D_{z,i} \indep Z_i \forall z
$$

It reads: The potential *treatment* is independent of the instrument

## Assumptions

### Exclusion restriction

$$
Y_{(d,z),i} = Y_{(d,z'),i} = Y_{d,i} \forall z, z', d, i
$$


. . . 

:::callout-note
"Exclusion restriction" means that we can **exclude** the instrument $z$ from the outcome equation, once the treatment is accounted for
:::

. . . 

It can also be described as a "full mediation" assumption: the whole effect of the instrument on the outcome goes through the treatment! 

. . .

Can this be tested?

## Assumptions
### Monotonicity

$$
D_{z=1,i} \geq D_{z=0,i} \forall i
$$

. . .

This assumption is tricky! And it sounds more harmless than it is.

It implies that the instrument affects *everyone* in the same direction: an instrument cannot induce some people to receive the treatment, and discourage some other people to receive the treatment

## Assumptions
### SUTVA and Positivity

Usually not discussed much in the context of IV, but remember that we are generally assuming **SUTVA** (consistency + non interference + no relevant versions of the treatment)

**Positivity** is required whenever we need to condition for certain covariates $X$, like in the case of *conditional* IV analyses.

## Estimation

There are several frameworks to conduct estimation in the IV settings. We are going to discuss two common ones:

. . .


* The 2SLS (Two-stages-least-squares)

* The Wald estimator (or ratio estimator)

. . . 

After showing how they work in practice, we are going to focus on best practices and potential issues to consider

## Estimation

We can estimate the ATE among complier (i.e., LATE):

$$
LATE = \frac{\text{Reduced Form}}{\text{Compliance Ratio}} = \frac{\text{ITT}}{\text{P(Complier)}}
$$
$$
= \frac{Z \rightarrow Y}{Z \rightarrow D} = \frac{E[Y|Z=1] - E[Y|Z=0]}{E[D|Z=1] - E[D|Z=0]}
$$
$$
= \frac{C(Z,Y)}{V(Z)}/\frac{C(Z,D)}{V(Z)}
$$

$$
\frac{(Z'Z)^{-1}(Z'Y)}{(Z'Z)^{-1}(Z'D)} = (Z'D)^{-1}(Z'Y)
$$
