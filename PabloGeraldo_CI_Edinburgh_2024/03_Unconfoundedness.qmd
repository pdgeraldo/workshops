# Outline {background-color="#17a091"}

## Lecture 3: Selection on observables

During this lecture, we will cover one of the most popular identification strategies: selection on observables, also known as conditional ignorability/independence (stats), unconfoundedness (econ), or conditional exchangeability (epi)

* First, we will locate it under the general umbrella of [observational studies](). 

* Then we will review the required assumptions and show the identication results

* Finally, we will discuss common estimation methods: regression, subclassification and matching, weighting, and augmented estimators

## What is an observational study?

We already discussed the importance of **random assignment** to justify drawing causal conclusions and conduct statistical inference

. . .

Observational data is generated when the treatment of interest is **not** in control of the researcher (e.g., survey data, administrative records, etc.)

. . .

An observational study is an attempt to use observational data to *approximate* causal conclusions (or, as some would say, "to approximate an experiment")

. . .

While, in experiments, the connection between potential and observed outcomes is justified by design, in observational studies it relies on assumptions
